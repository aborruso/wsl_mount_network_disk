# Network Drive Mounter Script
=====================================

This script is used to mount and unmount network drives on a Linux system.

## Usage
---------

To use this script, simply run it with the drive letter as an argument. For example:

```bash
./mount_network_disk.sh T
```

This will mount the network drive with the letter T in the `/mnt/t` directory.

## Confirmation Prompts
----------------------

The script will ask for confirmation before mounting or unmounting a drive. If you choose to cancel the operation, the script will exit.

## Requirements
------------

* The `drvfs` file system must be installed and configured on your system.
* The `sudo` command must be configured to allow the script to run with elevated privileges.

## Troubleshooting
-----------------

If you encounter any issues with the script, check the following:

* Make sure the drive letter is correct and the drive is not already mounted.
* Check the system logs for any error messages related to the `drvfs` file system or the `sudo` command.
